# Indian Electoral Data Analysis - DV Project

This project analyzes Indian electoral data, exploring voting trends, party distributions, candidate demographics, and more.

## Introduction

This repository contains code for analyzing Indian electoral data sourced from Kaggle. The data includes information on candidates, parties, constituencies, and voting statistics from various Indian elections.

## Usage

The provided code includes functions for visualizing different aspects of Indian electoral data. Here's how you can use them:

1. **Pie Chart: Vote share**: Visualizes the distribution of votes among parties in a constituency or state.

2. **Horizontal Bar**: Displays the total votes received by different parties in a constituency, state, or nationwide.

3. **Line Plot**: Shows the trend of votes for specific parties over different years.

4. **Wordcloud**: Generates word clouds based on the number of candidates or the vote share of parties.

## Code Structure

The code is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of electoral data analysis. Here's a brief overview:

- **Data Import**: Imports and preprocesses the electoral data.
- **Voting Trends**: Visualizes voting trends using pie charts, horizontal bars, and line plots.
- **Candidate Demographics**: Analyzes candidate demographics, such as sex distribution.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Integrates electoral data with state boundary maps for geospatial analysis.

## Requirements

To run this code, you'll need the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Wordcloud
- Geopandas

## Acknowledgements

- The electoral data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.
- State boundary shapefiles are obtained from a publicly available source.

## How to Run the Code

1. Ensure you have installed all the required libraries mentioned in the "Requirements" section.
2. Download the provided Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) and the CSV file containing the electoral data.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
4. Run each cell of the notebook sequentially to execute the code and generate visualizations.
5. Modify the function parameters as needed to analyze different aspects of the electoral data.
